In this job, we want to test to see if the crowd can determine
the type of semantic relationship that joins two concepts.
We are showing them only those concept pairs from the SemMedDB gold
standard which were determined by expert annotators to be
involved in a predication.

Therefore, this task tries to measure only the semantic
relationship. Precision and recall are dealt with in other
tasks.

Finally, the 5 choices provided loosely represent the five major
semantic categories of the UMLS semantic network. The choices
are filtered down dramatically based on the kinds of predicates
which actually are used in SemMedDB (e.g., there are 9 predicates
under "physically related to", but here the only choice is
"part of", since that is the only predicate used by SemMedDB.

Title: Determining how one concept is related to another


<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>In this task, you will be helping scientists determine what kind of relationship exists between two biomedical concepts according to a sentence.</p>


<h3>The Task</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Read a given sentence. Two concepts, the <span class="subject_text">subject</span> and the <span class="object_text">object</span> have been highlighted in the sentence. The definitions of the concepts are provided for your reference.</li>
  <li>Determine what the sentence says about how the <span class="subject_text">subject</span> is related to the <span class="object_text">object</span>.</li>
  <li>Rate how confident you are in your answer.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<ol>
  <li>[<span class="subject_text">subject</span>] is physically a part of [<span class="object_text">object</span>]:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>The <span class="subject_text">mitochondria</span>, which is found in the cytoplasm of a <span class="object_text">cell</span>, is responsible for generating the cell's energy.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>


  <li>[<span class="subject_text">subject</span>] is the location of [<span class="object_text">object</span>]:<br>

    <ul>
      <li>The <span class="subject_text">ribosome</span> is the cellular organelle where <span class="object_text">protein synthesis</span> occurs.</li>

    </ul>
  </li>


  <li>[<span class="subject_text">subject</span>] comes before [<span class="object_text">object</span>] in time:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Patients suffering from Barbett's syndrome first received <span class="subject_text">acupuncture</span> prior to a follow up <span class="object_text">MRI</span>.</li>
    </ul>

  </li>

  <li>[<span class="subject_text">subject</span>] is a process of, positively or negatively affects, or brings about [<span class="object_text">object</span>]:<br>

    <ul>
      <li>Homeostasis, the set of all processes which maintain a constant internal environment for an organism, is evidently not unique to just humans.</li>
      <li>Runners with <span class="subject_text">fractures</span> suffer a dramatic decrease in their <span class="object_text">running ability</span>.</li>

      <li>The protein <span class="subject_text">p53</span> is one of the best implicated factors involved in <span class="object_text">cancer</span>.</li>

    </ul>

  </li>


  <li>
    [<span class="subject_text">subject</span>] is a type of, given to, or occurs together with [<span class="object_text">object</span>]:
    <ul>
      <li><span class="subject_text">Crohn's disease</span>, an <span class="object_text">autoimmune disorder</span> where the immune system attacks the gastrointestinal tract, currently has no cure.</li>

      <li>While <span class="subject_text">flobantimab</span> is frequently perscribed to <span class="object_text">diabetic patients</span>, whether the drug actually has any effect is unknown.</li>

      <li>For a long time, doctors have observed that patients with <span class="object_text">hair loss</span> also have <span class="subject_text">persistent coughs</span>, but why this is the case is unknown.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

</ol>
